Another artificial-intelligence-cool-project from the _KRU: Knowledge, Reasoning and Uncertainty_ subject.

Given a dataset with a few tweets (a million or more) as a _ground-truth_ that we hope some _hard-working_ human has been spent time on qualifying Tweets as positive or negative, allows to classify new incoming Tweets using bayesian inference.

You can check your account to see if you're being positive on Twitter or not. Surprisingly most accounts on Twitter had more than 50% positive tweets (yes, even <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>)
