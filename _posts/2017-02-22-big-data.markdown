  We knew what _big data_ was since last year we were taught in _Distributed Systems_ how systems can be prepared to deal with lots of data and be able to deal efficiently with the data (and installed _Hadoop_!). That was the _sysadmins_ point of view.

  This year, in the _Software Techniques and Architechtures_ subject, we've been taught what is the trendy term _big data_ again, but now focusing on how to design a software architecture in order to deal with big amounts of data. Here is when _map-reduce_ paradigm comes.

  In this project, we're asked to use whatever language we desire (we choose Python, of course\*) and implement a _map-reduce_ architecture that, as an example, counts the words or letters in a text file (a really big text file!)

  Checkout how our projected ended looking:

  _\*it's academical and we're not worrying about high-end performance, otherwise we'd have chosen C++ or something compiled. (We know you were thinking that)_
